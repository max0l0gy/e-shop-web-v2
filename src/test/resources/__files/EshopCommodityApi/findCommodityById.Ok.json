  "overview": "The octopus Osya ate mushrooms, climbed onto the most beautiful palm tree and watched the warm leather bags melt under the sun and the bass of the chill-out sound of the Balian surf. Around the breeze was swarming and the Martins were buzzing, having dried out and sunbathed a little, Osia jumped from a palm tree into the azure of the ocean and disappeared into the abyss of bliss.",
