                    <b>I</b> can describe myself as a multimedia artist who works with emotions, modernization of carnival notions, and consumer culture in society. I like the combination of grotesque or imaginary images that caricatures of modern society and its stereotypes create. Inspired by current events, books, music, and trends in street and elite culture, my work must be both meaningful and meaningless to be used as a channel for interpretation with the viewer. I love looking at people's reactions and the thought process that leads to them. This is the most important aspect.

                    <b>In</b> my work, I analyze and transform reality into forms or plots, regardless of the medium I use. I try to make my works bring emotions, but unlike the purely aesthetic qualities of the objects of art institutions, they bring utilitarian benefits to space.
