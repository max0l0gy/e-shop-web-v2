                   <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>
                    <p>TITS ON FIRE believes that clothes and objects in your home reflect your personality. My work is hand-made and hand-painted, one by one. That is why each item in the collection has its own drawing and idea specifically for a specific color (or shape) of a T-shirt//ceramics, etc.</p>
                    <p>TITS ON FIRE doesn't do a million things with the same drawing if it exists - it one. Repeating the same drawing is possible on a different background color and in a different palette or on the same background color, but the details/colors will be different.</p>
                    <p>TITS ON FIRE approach the creation process like a painting masterpiece, starting with sketching on paper, then thinking about colors, then underpainting on fabric, painting with color, outlining/contouring and make shadows from MILLION of DOTS.)) The process of creating one item takes 20-25 hours of work, depending on the complexity and size. This is not counting the drying and setting of the paint on the fabric. Ceramic objects are also created by hand, fired two times (without and with glazes) the process is long and not always predictable, repetitions are possible, but with changes or additions.</p>
                    <p>All the ceramics are dishwasher safe. They are thin, light and look fragile, but trust me they are stronger than they look! Most of them are microwave safe too - except for ones with gold.</p>
