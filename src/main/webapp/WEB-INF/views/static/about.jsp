                        <p>
                        TITS ON FIRE is an artistic and fashion label that aims to bridge the gap
                        between hand-made works of art and mass production.
                        Founded by Russian artist Victoria Romanovich in 2018,
                        the TITS ON FIRE label is best known for handcrafted paintings on objects which look like a machine print.
                        Each stroke and dot on ceramic or cotton surfaces have an idea at the heart of the sketch and further elaboration.
                        </p>

                        The artist studied two disciplines: Fashion Design and Fine Art (contemporary art) at the British Higher School of Art and Design (Moscow). She received a BA in 2019 and has exhibited and participated in artist exhibitions/competitions since 2015. The recent exhibition ‘SOUP’ at ‘ZIL cultural center’ (Moscow) included her ceramic installation in the frame of the 8th international biennale of contemporary art. The combination of the knowledge gained form the basis for a unique style of creating clothes and decor items.
